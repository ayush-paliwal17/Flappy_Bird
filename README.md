# Flappy_Bird
My Take at the Flappy Bird game, Developed using Pygame module of Python. 
The game automatically increases the difficulty as the score increases and also stores the Highest Score.

#Requirements - 
1. Python - Can be downloaded directly using the link https://www.python.org/downloads , make sure you download python according to your System.
2. Pygame - This Python module can be installed using the package manager for python i.e. PIP. Use the command 'pip install pygame' in your terminal to download and install pygame.

#Suggestions - 
I suggest you use an IDE such as VSCode for smooth experience. 

Feel free to modify the script on your local system according to your taste.
